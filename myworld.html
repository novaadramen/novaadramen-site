    <div class="mb-5">
      <h4>Where It All Began</h4>
      <p>
        I was born on 12 November 1986 in Sri Lanka to George Samuel Mendis and Renuka Mendis. I grew up in Colombo, attending Ananda College from primary through high school. My childhood was a blend of music, leadership, and discipline. I was a Scout Cub, played football, served as Vice Captain of the team, swam competitively, and joined the LEO Club. I was also part of ‚ÄúRhythm of the Maroons,‚Äù our school band, and a proud board member of the Music Circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Music wasn't just a hobby, it was part of my identity. I completed my Bhatkhande entry exams in India for Indian classical vocal music. While my mother encouraged my creative and educational pursuits, my father worked tirelessly in the Middle East and Japan to provide for our family.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-5">
      <h4>The Career Climb</h4>
      <p>
        Right after my A/Ls, I started at AES Kelanitissa Power Plant on a temporary assignment. Though I qualified for a government-sponsored degree, I chose hands-on experience over the lecture hall. My journey led me through a trainee role at Trans Screen Pvt Ltd, and soon after, a life-changing position at HSBC as a Banking Assistant in the call center.
      </p>
      <p>
        There, I faced my biggest fear ‚Äî speaking on the phone. But HSBC taught me discipline, etiquette, and confidence. In 2013, I paused everything to pursue my passion, entering Derana Dream Star, a reality singing competition. Out of 65,000 contestants, I reached the Top 12. For the next 1.5 years, I performed as a lead vocalist in a band called Sparrows. Yet, something felt incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>
        I returned to banking, joining Pan Asia Bank as a Call Center Agent, then growing into a Service Quality Officer. This role introduced me to basic data analysis, performance reports, ATM error metrics, and team productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2015, a leap of faith took me to the UAE. I joined Royal Rose Hotel as a Delighted to Serve Agent, eventually becoming Acting Night Manager. But I wanted more. I cross-trained in HR and got appointed as HR Coordinator, just days before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, a trial by fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        By October 2021, I joined City Seasons Al Hamra Hotel as an HR Executive. My role quickly expanded, and by the time I left in 2023, I had become Assistant HR Manager. In 2022, I married my wife Aeryll at the very hotel (Royal Rose Hotel) where our paths first crossed. Together, we made a bold decision: to migrate to the UK in search of a shared future.
      </p>

    <div class="mb-5">
      <h4>The Setback That Reshaped Me</h4>
      <p>
        My UK journey didn‚Äôt begin with a dream job,it began with closed doors and quiet struggles.<br>  
        I took on roles like Store Manager and Marketing Analyst, not to climb, but to survive.  
        And in that silence, something unexpected happened: I discovered a new voice through code.<br><br>

        Learning Python and building systems wasn‚Äôt just about upskilling, it was healing.  
        Each line of code became a way to rebuild my confidence, brick by brick.<br><br>

        I stepped away from roles that didn‚Äôt honour the fire within me and turned to tech
        not as an escape, but as a tool and a testament.<br><br>

        I began thinking back to all the moments in my HR journey when I had said,  <br>
        *"I wish I had a system for this."*  <br>
        So I started researching global trends, feasibility, real-world gaps and began building the tools I once wished for.<br><br>

        That‚Äôs how **Novaadramen** was born:  <br>
        ‚ÄúNova‚Äù for star.  <br>
        ‚ÄúAd‚Äù for Adishaka.  <br>
        ‚ÄúRa‚Äù for Rajiva.  <br>
        ‚ÄúMen‚Äù for Mendis.  <br>
        A tribute to becoming the star I was always meant to be.

      <h4>Passion Beyond the R√©sum√©</h4>
      <p>
        Beyond job titles and job descriptions, I‚Äôve always had a restless creative streak.<br>
        I‚Äôve written scripts, edited videos, recorded vocals, designed posters, captured portraits, and even built systems from scratch just to solve everyday problems.
        Whether it was preparing a hotel event slideshow overnight or composing an HR announcement video on short notice. <br><br>I‚Äôve never shied away from the unfamiliar.<br><br>
        If I didn‚Äôt know how to do something, I‚Äôd figure it out, learn the software, test the tool, and deliver anyway.
        That‚Äôs what passion looks like to me: not perfection, but persistence with curiosity.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
      <h4>Where I Stand Today</h4>
      <p>
        Whether I‚Äôm capturing a fleeting smile through my lens or unpacking everyday challenges on my YouTube channel, creativity has always been my way of making sense of the world.<br>
        I‚Äôm endlessly curious about people, patterns, behaviours, and the little things we all experience but rarely talk about.<br><br>
        Photography helps me notice the beauty in stillness. Video helps me give voice to questions that matter.
        Neither was born for applause, they were born from the need to stay connected, expressive, and useful, even when life felt uncertain.
        For me, creating isn't about being seen,it‚Äôs about seeing more deeply.

    <p class="text-center lead">
      Curiosity is my fuel!<br><br>whether it‚Äôs stress management, workplace trends, or simple daily habits we overlook.<br>  
      If it sparks a question in me, I research it, simplify it, and share it with the world.<br><br>

      That‚Äôs how this channel was born: not out of a need for fame, but a desire to grow and give back.  
      It also helps me stay sharp with my multimedia editing skills and turn my spare time into something meaningful.<br><br>

      This channel isn‚Äôt about likes or views. <br><br> 
      It‚Äôs about making sure my skills always serve a purpose, for myself and for those who might benefit from what I learn.

    <p class="text-center lead">
      To see the world through a lens is something magical.<br><br>
      Photography lets me pause what the naked eye only glimpses for a moment,and hold onto it.<br><br>

      I‚Äôve done a few paid shoots, but most of my work?  It‚Äôs passion-led.<br>  
      So, don‚Äôt expect world-class perfection here, that‚Äôs not the goal.<br><br>

      What you will find is raw creativity.<br>
      Honest frames.<br>
      Unfiltered glimpses of how I see beauty, people, spaces, and stillness.<br><br>

      This is not a gallery to impress, it‚Äôs a gallery to express.
